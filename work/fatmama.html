    <p>FatMama is a character I've developed during a game design course.
    </br>
    It featured the full process of creating a video game character:
    At first the initial Idea was developed and concepts were drawn.
    References were gathered and the character was blocked out using Z-Spheres.
    A high-poly mesh was created in ZBrush. To get a game-ready, low-poly mesh the high-poly model was remeshed and uv'd in 3D-Coat.
    Color and normal-maps were generated in XNormal.
    The Character was then rigged and animated using keyframe-animation in Maya.
    In addition, a small game was created around the character in Unity 3D.
    All other models in this game were also made by me.
    </br>
    FatMama dreams of a world of sweets while being very hungry.
    She can't eat things that are bigger than her otherwise she'll get hurt.
    </p>
