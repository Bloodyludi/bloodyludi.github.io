            <h3>About Myself</h3>
            <p><strong>Welcome, I'm Ludwig Lauer.</strong> I think the best way to describe myself, is to call me a digital Allrounder.
                </br>I've been studiying Computer Science for Media at the Harz University of Applied Sciences since 2011.
                While constantly evolving and looking into new things, my passions are coding and computer graphics.
                </br>Also, I like to animate <span class="thingsAni">things.</span>
