    HUE is an arcade game for mobile devices.
    You have to navigate a square through some labyrinth levels to reach the finish.
    Also, there are many color planes you have to pass.
    Therefore, the square has to change its color to the color of the planes like a chameleon.
    An important aspect of the game is that you can also pass planes if you are a part of the mixed color.
    The title based on one part of the chromatic circle.

    HUE was created during the Global Game Jam 2014 by Sabina Huehne, Waldemar Krause and Me in Leipzig.
    I was responsible for the overall development, some design decisions and the initial idea.
    The game was developed in Unity and is planned to be released for Android and iOS.
