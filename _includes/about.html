            <h3>About Myself</h3>
            <p><strong>Welcome, I'm Ludwig Lauer.</strong> I would like to describe myself as a "Digital Allrounder". 
                </br>
                </br>
                I've been studying Computer Science for Media at the Harz University of Applied Sciences since 2011.
                While constantly evolving and looking into new things, my passions are coding and computer graphics.
                I am fastinated in playing and analysing the latest compter games.
                This is the reason, why I really like game development. 
                When I'm not sitting in front of the desktop, I spend my spare time by climbing onto mountains, playing guitar and fighting bears.
                </br>
                </br>
                Apart from coding, I also like to animate <span class="thingsAni">things.</span>
