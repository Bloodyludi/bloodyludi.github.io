      What's most entertaining way to use input devices like the Occulus Rift and Razer Hyrda you can come up with?
      Or something like that was the question we asked ourselves at the beginning of the project.
      Grahylus is what we came up with. In Grahylus you have to make your way through a circuit of tunnels with only two grappling guns.
      </br>
      Grahylus is the longest project i have worked on yet. It was developed by Alexander Johr and Me within a year.
      My part included the visual development of the game. The tunnel is composed of 16 modular parts in a varying order.
      Many parts have normal-maps transferred from high-poly models onto them.
      All parts were modeled, uv'd, baked and animated using Maya. Textures were done in Photoshop.
      The game was made in Unity 3D using C#.
